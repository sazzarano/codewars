Meanwhile... somewhere in a Pentagon basement
Your job is to compare two confidential documents that have come into your possession.

The first document has parts redacted, and the other one doesn't.

But the original (unredacted) document might be a fake!

You need to compare the two documents and decide if it is possible they are the same or not.

Kata Task
Return true if the two documents are possibly the same. Return false otherwise.

Notes
Each document is made of any visible characters, spaces, punctuation, and newlines \n
Any character might be redacted (except \n)
The redaction character is X
The redacted document is always the first one
